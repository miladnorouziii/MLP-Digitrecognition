# MLP Digit recognition

The example codes above are related to a 5-layer MLP NN (Input layer - 3 hidden layer - Output layer) classification for the problem of recognizing numbers from 0 to 9.

For this issue, the dataset available in the link below has been used. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data (Also available in Dataset folder)

Run the main.py file to run the code. After running the code, you will need to specify the following.

* The dataset path
* If you want to use a previously saved model, the path to the saved model must be specified
* The number of iteration steps (Epochs)
* Data validation percentage
* Test set percentage
* Learning rate
* Batch size
* Optimizer model
* The number of neurons in the first layer
* The number of neurons in the second layer
* The number of neurons in the third layer
